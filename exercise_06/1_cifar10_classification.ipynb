As explained in the chapter above, we used the transformation functions `RescaleTransform`, `NormalizeTransform` and `FlattenTransform` to achieve this shape. These are the general steps that you need to perform on the data before you can start training. Of course, all these steps have to be applied to our three dataset splits (train, val and test split). In other words, preprocessing involves preparing the data before is can be used for training and inference. \n",

For example, you can <b>flip the images horizontally</b> or <b>blur the images</b> and use these new images to enlarge the dataset. This idea is called Data Augmentation and it involves methods that alter the training images to generate a synthetic dataset that is larger than your original dataset. This will hopefully improve the performance of your model. There is one important difference between data augmentation and data preprocessing: The transformation methods used to enlarge your dataset should only be applied to the training data. The validation and test data should not be affected by these methods.\n",

    "Random search is very similar to grid search, with the only difference, that instead of providing specific values for every hyperparameter, you only define a range for each hyperparameter - then, the values are sampled randomly from the provided ranges.\n",

    "![alt text](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cIDuR.png \"\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure above illustrates the difference in the hyperparameter space exploration between grid search and random search: assume you have 2 hyperparameters with each 3 values. Running a grid search results in training $3^2=9$ different models - but in the end, you've just tired out 3 values for each parameter. For random search on the other hand, after training 9 models you'll have tried out 9 different values for each hyperparameter, which often leads much faster to good results.\n",
    "\n",
