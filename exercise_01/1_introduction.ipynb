We use your matriculation number and send an email with the login details to the mail account associated. When in doubt, login into tum-online and check your mails there. You will get an id which we need in the next step. If you are an external student, please contact us directly via the mailing list so that we can issue you a personal account since the automatic registration uses the TUM native matriculation numbers for registration.\n",

    "4. Within the working period, you can submit as many solutions as you want to get the best possible score. Once the submission closes up, you can no longer submit any newer models for graded evaluation."
