    "\n",
    "Welcome to this notebook where you'll be training an autoencoder using the MNIST dataset, which comprises handwritten digits. This exercise is the last where we present you with a structured skeleton to work with. However, in following exercises, we will only provide you with the dataset, task, and a test scenario, enabling you to test your skills and compete with your peers on our leaderboards. Get ready to dive in and showcase your deep learning expertise!\n",

    "\n",
    "Autoencoders have various applications, including unsupervised pretraining using unlabeled data, followed by fine-tuning the encoder with labeled data. This approach can greatly enhance performance when there is only a little amount of labeled data but a lot of unlabeled data available.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will use the MNIST dataset, consisting of 60,000 images of handwritten digits. However, not all the image labels are available to you. Your first objective is to train an autoencoder to accurately reproduce these unlabeled images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, you will transfer the weights of the pretrained encoder and perform fine-tuning on a classifier using the available labeled data. This technique is commonly known as **transfer learning**, which allows you to leverage the knowledge gained from the autoencoder to improve the classification of the handwritten digits."

The `classifier` has a fixed task, generating predictions given a one-dimensional input. On the other hand, the `encoder`'s task is to extract meaningful information from the input, enabling the classifier to make accurate decisions. \n",

We have no money left to pay the student to create more labels, and labeling the data ourselves is out of question. A commonly used approach would be to apply data augmentation to maximize the potential of our limited labeled data, but here we provide another way to solve this problem: **transfer learning**.\n",
    "\n",

To train the autoencoder, we use the mean squared error loss, which calculates the discrepancy between the input pixels and the output pixels. The best part is that this loss function doesn't require any labels!\n",
    "\n",
    "By pretraining the autoencoder in this way on a large amount of unlabeled data, we can capture valuable latent representations of the input images.
